Shortcodes to replace those in the parent theme
====================

Each of Enfold shortcodes/Avia Layout Builder elements are setup as individual files. You customize each file as needed by copying it from
enfold/config-templatebuilder/avia-shortcodes folder to this one in your child theme.

This works because of the function avia_include_shortcode_template in this child theme's functions.php.
